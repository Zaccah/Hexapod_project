# Hexapod project
This project is about an Hexapod robot manufactured by Adeept (Hexapod Spider Robot) programmed from scratch in order to obtain customized features and movements. We developed an Arduino firmware and Matlab code. Arduino firmware is only used in order to respond to Matlab code commands, all computations are performed on the PC in Matlab.
Main entry point of the project is the file `hexapod_state_machine.m` in which the complete logic for the state machine is implemented. A full technical explanation of the project is reported in the `Hexapod_report.pdf`.
